# Instant-Messenger
This is an Instant Messenger application I made using Python/Tkinter/Google Firebase.
The GUI is simple, using Tkinter and all data is stored inside google Firebase, linked to the user account. The user can change their name, text color, background color, and font
and this is all saved in Firebase, allowing the user to access their settings wherever they log into the app from. The application was made exclusively for my girlfriend and I,
so no you cannot make an account.
